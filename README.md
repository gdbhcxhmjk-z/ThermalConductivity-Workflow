# About ThermalConductivity-Workflow
ThermalConductivity-Workflow is designed to compute thermal conductivity of different materials based on Non-Equilibrium &amp; Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulations. It is supported by [dflow](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow), a Python framework for constructing scientific computing workflows.

## About dflow
With the power of dflow, users can easily minitor the whole workflow of ThermalConductivity tasks and dispatch their tasks to various computational resources. Before you use it, you should have dflow installed on your host computer (your PC or a remote server).

It it necessary to emphasize that, the computational nodes and monitor nodes are seperated. With dflow, you can deploy dflow and ThermalConductivity on your PC and achieve expensive computation on other resources (like Slurm and Cloud Platform) without any further effort.

Instructions of dflow installation are provided in detail on its [Github page](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow#Installdflow). Prerequisites of dflow usage are Docker and Kubenetes, where their main pages ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) &amp; [Kubenetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) include how you can install them. Besides, dflow repo also provides with easy-install shell scripts on [dflow/scripts](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/tree/master/scripts) to install Docker &amp; Kubenetes &amp; dflow and make port-forwarding.

# Environment Installation
The overall workflow logic is as follows: The necessary preparation files for the workflow are uploaded to a remote server (currently, Bohrium provides free resources for this part). Then, the remote server distributes the tasks to different supercomputing resources and computing environments based on the set parameters. In practice, we need to prepare two parts of the environment.
* tcflow, the necessary package in the host machine
* computational environment, needed in both host and computing machine
## Installation of task submission environment.
  
The task submission environment can be from any device, whether it is a personal PC or a connected supercomputing head node. Its main task is to package the necessary preparation files and upload them to the remote server. This environment can be set up using pip installation.
```bash
pip install tcflow==0.0.22
```

## Installation of computing environment
The computational environment is supported by several third-party python packages. Dflow provides a framework for scheduling computing resources, but the actual computing environment needs to be configured in advance.
For users of [Bohrium](https://bohrium.dp.tech/), this step is relatively easy as we provide relevant images, which can be directly called. 

*Please note that registering a Bohrium account is essential for the visualization interface of the subsequent workflow, regardless of whether Bohrium computing resources are called or not.

For users of other computing resources, we have packed the required environment for most of the computational steps, which can be easily installed via pip.
Similar to the task submission environment:
```bash
pip install tcflow==0.0.22
```

In the workflow, the computing environment for LAMMPS needs to be prepared by the user. If you are using dp+LAMMPS, you can refer to the [Easy Install](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/install/easy-install.html) or [Install LAMMPS](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/install/install-lammps.html) documentation provided by DeepModeling for instructions on installing LAMMPS in conjunction with Deep Potential (dp).
For other cases or custom configurations, you can follow the specific requirements and instructions provided by LAMMPS. The official LAMMPS documentation (https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Manual.html) provides comprehensive information on how to install LAMMPS for different platforms and configurations. You can refer to the documentation that matches your specific setup and requirements.

*Example of LAMMPS environment installation, using conda for dp+LAMMPS in a GPU environment, referring to [Easy Install](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/install/easy-install.html).
```bash
conda create -n deepmd deepmd-kit=*=*gpu libdeepmd=*=*gpu lammps cudatoolkit=11.6 horovod -c https://conda.deepmodeling.com -c defaults
```

# Prepare Input Files
Firstly, we introduce the input files required for the ThermalConductivity.Input files in example/ have been prepared. 
The following files is needed:
* data.lammps, the input structure file of lammps format
* parameters.json, the settings for simulations and tasks
* machine.json, the settings for computing resources
* force field(if needed), the force field file used in lammps MD

|langevin_damp|float|The parameter of fix/langevin in LAMMPS. [fix/langevin](https://docs.lammps.org/fix_langevin.html)  TheÂ _damp_Â parameter is specified in time units and determines how rapidly the temperature is relaxed.
